## Binary Classification of PE Files (Malware or Benign) using Feature Extraction and Random Forest Model

# Description

This project aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files into two categories: Malware or Benign. It employs feature extraction techniques along with a Random Forest classifier. The model is deployed using Hugging Face's SageMaker service, and the client needs to provide necessary AWS credentials to access the deployed model.

# Model Deployment

The model is deployed on Hugging Face's SageMaker service. The endpoint model name is sagemaker-scikit-learn-2024-04-03-23-28-43-349. Pre-trained featurizers and the model itself have been saved for reusability and are available in the client folder. The following files are required for client-side usage:

imports_featurizer.joblib
section_names_featurizer.joblib
model (1).joblib

To access the deployed model, the client must provide the following AWS credentials:
client('sagemaker-runtime',
       region_name="us-east-1",
       aws_access_key_id="<>",
       aws_secret_access_key="<>",
       aws_session_token="<>")
       
# Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the project:

-  pefile
-  scikit-learn==1.2.1
-  joblib
-  nltk (install from GitHub: git+https://github.com/nltk/nltk#egg=nltk)

# Usage

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Obtain AWS credentials.

Provide AWS credentials and endpoint model name in your client script.

Use the provided featurizers and model for classification.
